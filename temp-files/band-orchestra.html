		<strong class="name">Ben George </strong>
		<strong class="position">Band &amp; Orchestra Sales</strong>
		<p>
		When asked what three words define himself, Ben chose the following: poised, unperturbed, and goofy. Raised on a farm on a little plot of land off the Pedernales River, Ben was surrounded by the folk guitar playing of his mother and step father. He later found an appreciation for the saxophone and jazz music. After being granted multiple merits in high school, Ben decided to attend Georgia State University's Jazz Performance Program. Upon leaving school, Ben moved back to Central Texas to continue to cultivate his sound and work at one of the best privately-owned music stores in the nation.
